# Timelapse-server

To start your Flask app:

  * You should place the app in the same directory where the SeaweedFS is.
  * You need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable: `export FLASK_APP=start_server.py`
  * Run the flask app by running this command: `flask run`
